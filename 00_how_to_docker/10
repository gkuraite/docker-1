# 10. Create a volume named hatchery.
#
# Volumes = directories that are stored outside of the containerâ€™s filesystem
# and which hold reusable and shareable data that can persist even when containers 
# are terminated. This data can be reused by the same service on redeployment, 
# or shared with other services.
