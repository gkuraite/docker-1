# 8. Launch a shell from an alpine container, and make sure that you can interact
# directly with the container via your terminal, and that the container deletes itself
# once the shellâ€™s execution is done.

docker run --interactive --tty --rm alpine /bin/sh

#  -i, --interactive : Keep STDIN open even if not attached
#  -t, --tty : Allocate a pseudo-TTY
#	using  -i and -t  will allow you to use the container like a 
#  traditional VM as long as the bash prompt is running.
#  --rm : Automatically remove the container when it exits
