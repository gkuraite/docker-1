# 4. Get the hello-world container from the Docker Hub, where it’s available.

docker pull hello-world

# to check if it worked : docker image ls
# Docker Hub is the place where open Docker images are stored.
# The the software first checked if this image is available on your computer
# and since it wasn’t it downloaded the image from Docker Hub. So getting an 
# image from Docker Hub works sort of automatically.
