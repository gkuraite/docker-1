# 30. Increase the number of copies of the marines service up to twenty, because there’s
# never enough Marines to eliminate Zergs. (Remember to take a look at the tasks
# and logs of the service, you’ll see, it’s fun.)

docker service update --replicas 20 marines

# docker service scale --detach marines=20

# scale : Scale one or multiple replicated services
# -d, --detach   Exit immediately instead of waiting for the service to converge
